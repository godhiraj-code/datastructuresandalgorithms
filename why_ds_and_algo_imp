Why are Data Structures and Algorithms important?
 - To develop memory and time efficient applications. 
 
- We developers will take some data (input), process it and generate some output. 
For example, let us consider a google map application, where
 1.input is the source and destination i.e; starting place and where we need to go (destination)
 2.then google will process this input 
 3.and generate the best path for us to go from place 1 to place 2. 

Processing is where we use the Data Structures and Algorithms. 
Use the graph data structures and djkstra algorithms in the above case to generate an efficient path for us to go from place 1 to place 2. 
*** google in reality, use n no of complex algorithms and datastructures to accomplish the above mentioned task, this is just an example 
to understand why Data Structures and Algorithms are so important.


consider another example , where you go to a public library and found out that books are arranged in random order and then if you 
need to find a book , it will be time consuming.
On the other hand, if the librarian had arranged the books in an ordered way , then finding the book will take much less time. 

- Arranging the books is where data structure will be used.
- Finding the book is where algorithm will be used.
